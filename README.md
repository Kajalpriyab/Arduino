# Arduino
Here i did some assignments for school with an Arduino in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment - or 
Arduino Software (IDE). 

The assignments differ from simple tasks like turning the led light on and showing numbers on the Arduino, but also
a game. According to the game there will be shown a number. And the number on the screen shows how many times 
the button has to be pressed. When the button is pressed the exact same amount as the screen shows, the player wins. 
If not, there is going to be a short sound as a sign that the player failed to accomplish the task.
